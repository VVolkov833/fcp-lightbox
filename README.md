# Lightest Lightbox by FCP

Super lightweight Lighbox WordPress Plugin. It tracks the links to images on a page and makes them open in a popup Lightbox. It also adds prev-next navigation to galleries or image sequences.

## Technical features

It basically loads 2 super small files up to 2.5 kB each to the front-end, and that's it.

The plugin is friendly to caching and minifying plugins, and is not jQuery dependent (in case jQuery is loaded async).

The Lightbox can work outside WordPress just by including script.js and style.css anywhere on a page.

## Further development

Next version is planned to have the swipe support, unless too heavy
